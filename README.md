# Quiz-Challenge
Fourth week of the Sydney University coding bootcamp, this challenge consisted of developing a quiz from scratch using HTML/CSS and JavaScript. 

Within this challenge, we were required to use specific skills learnt in the past week. We covered web APIs and utilising DOM manipulation was the key aspect of the task. 

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
